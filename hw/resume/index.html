    Hi, My name is Yaniza Creamer and I am a junior at the University of Miami. I grew up in Worcester, MA and recently moved to Florida about two years ago. I am bilingual and enjoy teaching my friends how to speak spanish. Throughout my
      professional career I have developed a great work ethic, a multitude of communication skills and a passion for helping others. As a Public Relations major for me the important concept is putting peopleâ€™s needs before mine and making them feel
      satisfied.</p>
